# Definition of Done:

**Acceptance Criteria:** 
All user story acceptance criteria are met.

**Code Implementation:**  
The code for the user story is written, reviewed, and will be approved by peer developers.

**Unit Testing:** 
Unit tests for the user story are written and passed successfully.

**Integration Testing:**
The user story has been integrated with the existing codebase and passes integration tests.

**Documentation:**
Any required documentation, such as code comments and user guides, needs to be added.
For example:
    - For example:
    ```javascript
    /**
     * @param {string} email user's email address
     * @returns string Hashed email address
     */
    const hash = (email) => crypto.createHash('sha256').update(email).digest('hex');
    ```
    
**Dependencies:**
External dependencies or third-party integrations are validated to ensure they function correctly.

**Sprint Goal:** 
The sprint goal has been accomplished, and all scheduled tasks are completed.

**Demo:**
A sprint demo has been executed to present the completed user stories to stakeholders.

**Review:**
A sprint review meeting was conducted to collect feedback and implement any necessary adjustments.

**Documentation:** 
Documentation related to the sprint, such as sprint notes and the updated sprint backlog, is kept up-to-date.

**Continuous Integration:** 
The entirety of the code is merged into the main branch of the version control system.

**Testing:** 
Testing is conducted to verify that the work completed during the sprint does not introduce any new issues.

**Deployment:** 
The tasks completed during the sprint are prepared for deployment to the production environment.

The team collectively agreed upon and accepted the DOD
